# Astral by Gazownicy (2nd @ BiteHack 2023)

Astral is an app that listens to your microphone and provides quick information about words it hears is a useful tool for anyone who needs to quickly access information on the go. This app utilizes advanced voice recognition technology to identify words spoken into the microphone and provides relevant information in real-time.

For example, if the app hears the word "force," it could display a list of relevant equations and formulas related to the concept of force. Similarly, if the app hears the word "history," it could provide a summary of historical events related to the word or a list of important figures in history associated with that word.

This app could be particularly useful for students or professionals who need to quickly access information while studying or working. For example, a student studying physics could use this app to quickly access relevant formulas and equations while solving problems, without having to search through a textbook or online resources. Similarly, a professional working in a technical field could use this app to quickly access relevant information while working on a project or in a meeting.
